 Underpaid Game Developer Studios Project: Time Loop Game
 
  You're taking a tour of an ancient antique castle when you find yourself suddenly seperated from the tour guide! While stumbling around the castle, you find an artifact that you probably shouldn't have touched! When you touch the artifact, it explodes into several pieces hidden around the castle and places you inside of a time loop. Collect all the hidden pieces within the timeloop to break the loop and find the exit.
